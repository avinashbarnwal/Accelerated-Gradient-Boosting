# Accelerated-Gradient-Boosting

Gradient Boosting model are suppose to provide stellar performance for supervised learning.Recently it hs been proven tht we can have faster convergence with Nestrov's momentum sequence for optimization.This is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02042).

Author has shown the results in R. This is the python implementation of the same.

Following is the algorithm:-
